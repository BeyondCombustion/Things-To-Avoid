## Avoid these vapes

This part isn't going to cover each specific model and instead will primarily mention brands, despite a brand making one good/working vaporizer they are on this list because of consistent inadequate/unreliable models. 

Questions about these specific vaporizers/brands may be removed. Discussion about why the vaporizer or brand should be avoided is acceptable but searching the name should result with the answer.

In general vapes that are on the avoid lists are there because of: 1) poor quality materials 2) an airpath that is not isolated from electronics.
